      <p>
        Built from 30 years of product innovation at SunPower, our Helix mechanical
        system is designed to maximize your roof’s energy potential.
        With flexible ballast and anchor options, industry-leading roof<span class="footnotes-content">coverage<small class="footnotes">8</small></span>, and a 10-degree tilt angle, the Helix platform perfectly optimizes the power
        density and energy yield potential of your roof. Add to that our high-efficiency solar panels, and
        you get more power per panel, more power per roof, and significantly greater savings. That’s
        63% more power per roof, and 72% more energy over the life of your<span class="footnotes-content">system.<small class="footnotes">7</small></span>

      <p>
        A rooftop can be a brutally unforgiving place, with temperature swings, intense sunlight, hail
        and high winds. Well-secured energy cables are crucial to protecting your investment. Our
        engineers developed innovative new ways to ensure that wires and cables are protected from
        abuse and abrasion. Incredibly simple and easy to install, Helix cable clips, cones and trays are
        designed to prevent costly downtime.

      <h2>Power Station: Wired for Success</h2>
      <p>
        Built in a quality-controlled environment, the electrical
        connections of the Helix power station are plug-and-play for
        easy interconnection. Inverters and panel boards arrive on-site ready for
        fast installation, with no field wiring or tools required.
        Not only does this reduce installation  time, it greatly improves system
        reliability. After all, when 100% of manual power station wiring is removed,
        so are the human errors that may come with it.
